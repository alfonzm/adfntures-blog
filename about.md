This is Alfonz Montelibano and Danica Impang (a.k.a. Fonx & Nix), and we're on a journey of filling that [map](/destinations) below with more of those little black markers.

Our country, the Philippines, is known for its shitty internet service providers, pollution and corrupt politicians, but it's also fortunate to be teemed with majestic sceneries, beautiful beaches and several other hidden gems, and that's our goalâ€”to see and experience first-hand as many of those as we can. This website will be our journal thingy of sorts.
