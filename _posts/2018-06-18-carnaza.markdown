We haven’t written a blog post for our trips in a long time but last weekend we’ve finally been to a place that deserves one.

If there’s one underrated gem that deserves more recognition than it currently has, it’s this beautiful island at the tip of northern Cebu that's as majestic as it is tiny—_Carnaza_.

Carnaza is not the place to whip out your GoPros and selfie sticks and take pictures all day.

It’s a place where you let one hand run under the soft white sand, while the other is holding either an ice-cold bottle of beer or a warm cup of coffee, depending on the time of day. Or take a dip and let every inch of your body soak and absorb the cool, salty ocean water that you’d wish you could hold your breath and stay under the water for just a little bit longer.

It’s where you bask yourself in the sun, letting her paint your skin with sunburns and tan lines while reading your favorite book, until the sound of the waves crashing into the shore sing you to sleep.

It’s where locals rush to find and prepare you a room from one of their friend’s houses in the barrio because the resort is fully booked, and where you chat with the home owners while they prepare you a hearty home-cooked meal for breakfast in their humble abodes while the sun is still about to rise.

It’s where "island hopping" is actually a tour around islets and hidden coves that don’t even have names yet and guides haven’t even gone to before.

It’s where, just a stone’s throw away from your window, fishermen are tending to their catch for the day while their kids are carelessly swimming around letting the waves cradle them back and forth to the sand.

Finally, it’s a place where you, you know, just have a laid-back island life experience that mere images in an Instagram feed cannot capture and words in a blog article are incapable of expressing.


# Appendix

The local people in Carnaza have been very kind to accommodate us, tour us around the place and even cook meals for us in their homes, showing us true Filipino hospitality at its best. So we thought we’d give back to them by sharing their package tours and details of our trip.

### Carnaza Island Package Tour

The guys at the [Psalms Restaurant](https://www.facebook.com/psalmsrestaurant/) (they have rooms for rent too where we stayed on our 2nd night) are offering this new all-in package tour on June 23-24 (we're not really sure if they're offering it on other dates as well).

### Island Hopping Tour
- We took only the island hopping tour with a small private boat from the Psalms guys (see above) for P1,500.

### Transpo

### Accommodation
- P200/2 pax woodsheds – those popular triangular wooden tents that [Carnaza Eco Park](https://www.facebook.com/carnazaecopark/) is known for

- or...

- P600 room for rent at Narciso’s house. You can book via [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/21624194?s=51) or PM them at their [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/carnazaislandcebu/)

There are also P300/head rooms above Psalms Restaurant that we highly recommend because the beach is literally just outside your room.

### Food
- The staff at Carnaza Eco Park can cook rice and canned goods for you. They also have barbecue at night.
- There's a small canteen at Carnaza Eco Park that sells drinks—ice is kinda rare though so don't expect to get cold drinks all the time. You can also take a 3-min habal-habal ride (P20) to the barrio.
- There’s also a restaurant called [Psalms Restaurant](https://www.facebook.com/psalmsrestaurant) which is just a habal-habal ride to the barrio from Carnaza Eco Park.

Actually, just ask the locals around if there's anything you need—they are all kind enough to make sure their guests have the most memorable and comfortable stay at their humble island. Just make sure to give back to them by being a responsible traveler and not leave any trace!
