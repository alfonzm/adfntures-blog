I love how much music plays a role in our relationship.

I love how much we influence each other's tastes in music—how when you introduce me to a new band or genre I'd get hooked to it more than you do and, conversely, how I'd introduce you to a new band or genre and you'd get hooked to it more than I do.

I love how we'd type our LSS song lyrics on chat and we'd compete who gets to the chorus part first.

I love how "who's your most favorite band/artist" is the most difficult thing to answer so we'd just pick our favorite band from a certain period in our life. "Which genre?" _Uhh, rock._ "Could you be more specific?"

I love how on random Sunday mornings you'd send me a Spotify link of a new song you know I'd like and we'd spend the rest of the morning discovering more songs from that artist because we just love his musical style so much we'd forget about the lyrics and how weeks later we'd revisit that same song's lyrics and realize that it's actually a sad, devastating love song we can relate to so much, so we'd go down the rabbit hole and listen to the rest of the album's songs again this time trying to interpret the words and realize all the songs we've been singing to all this time are revolving around that same heartbreaking theme.

I love those little moments when I'd just grab a guitar or ukelele and start strumming any song and we'd start singing to our heart's content until we'd run out of songs to play. Or how we'd plan about starting a duo band and start thinking of possible names for our imaginary band. Or how we'd always talk about how I'd teach our future kids different instruments and we'd form a band and perform a mini-concert for you—I should definitely do that, that'd be the cutest thing ever.

I love when we make playlists for each other—just look at the list of playlists we've made and traded, it's crazy. We'd make a playlist for every feeling, mood, weather, genre, newly discovered genre, new favorite artist, or new favorite movie soundtrack. Feel happy? Make a playlist. Nostalgic? Playlist. Prepping for a roadtrip? Huge playlist.

Speaking of road trips, I love how we'd make 4-hour road trips to the southern tip of Cebu feel like a breeze because we'd keep pressing next on the player until we'd find Umaapaw or Chocolate or some other singable songs and just sing our lungs out—me drumming on the steering wheel and you harmonizing Becky's (The Honey Trees) or Julia Stone's parts. I'd still chuckle remembering that time you pushed my hand away from the skip button right when your song came on, yelling "don't you dare skip that, don't you fuck with me!" And don't get me started on that 1000-song playlist you made for me by stalking and downloading literally every, single, fucking, song, off my years worth of Last.fm scrobbles, and putting them into a flash drive for me to listen during my commutes to work every day. You are insane, I love you.

I love how we'd watch a film solely because we knew that film's got The Shins and Iron & Wine on its soundtrack, or how you're dying to see this local indie film because B.P. Valenzeula is playing on its trailers, or how we'd get excited when an instrumental rendition of a Radiohead song plays on a TV show. I love those moments when we go "we know that song it's in our new playlist! I'll check it later" or, "oh this song's in one of the films we watched! I forgot the title lemme check," and so a tip-of-my-tongue search journey begins. And I'd still get goosebumps rewatching Keira Knightley & Mark Ruffalo's "A Step You Can't Take Back" scene, or Sing Street's "Up" scene, or when Peer Pressure starts playing in the elephant parade scene in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind—I can't think of a better someone to spend those moments with for the first time than you.

I love how we always consider Wanderland 2016 to be our best day ever, and it probably will be for a long time. I love how we kept making guesses for the next year's lineup whole year round, stalked which artists are currently touring, and waited for the announcement countdown down to the last second, followed by a barrage of chat messages in all caps because "OMGGGG DEATH CAB FOR CUTIE!" Not only did we finally get to see and hear Transatlanticism performed in front of our eyes, we also got introduced to new great artists and, more importantly, to the local indie music scene. I love how the following day we'd attempt to treat our post-concert depression by rewatching videos of the performances over and over again, or blasting the songs on the speakers on repeat even when days, weeks have already gone by. Oh, and that opening guitar riff in Perth still gives us the chills.

I love when our favorite artists release new music and we'd get excited to every teaser, release date announcement, EP, or single released. Then when a new LP finally drops, we'd listen to the whole album track by track for the first time together and discuss how much their style changed and how much we preferred the old sound and hate the new synthy sound but still like the band nonetheless and how we'd always agree which tracks are the best ones and the worst ones. Remember the frisson the first time we listened to Revelator Eyes and how it instantly became one of our top songs? Or how Clearest Blue, or J-Boy, had us raping the replay button like crazy? Good times.

God I love it when you talk to me about how a song makes you feel, what the words mean to you, what specific place, moment or abstract thing it reminds you of, and how you describe in detail how you think the song is meant to be listened to—usually it involves coffee and rain.

Finally, I love how I was even able to come up with and write this whole thing.

You are my chorus and I wish our song would never end.

_Happy 85 months!_
