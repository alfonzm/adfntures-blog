It was around April last year when Fonx asked me, “Will you go to Wanderland with me next year?”, and I said yes in a heartbeat! Months later, when they announced that Death Cab for Cutie will be the co-headliner, our excitement got doubled, maybe even tripled. We immediately bought tickets even though the full lineup wasn't announced yet. The early bird discounted ticket prices were around P2600—a steal for a music festival with at least 6 amazing bands performing!

# Ready for Take-Off

Fast forward to December and the Wanderland lineup was complete. Fortunately for us, it turned out that most of the performers were already our favorites bands and artists: The Naked and Famous, San Cisco, even Cheats, and of course, Bon fucking Iver! Needless to say, our excitement only got quintillioned. We luckily got cheap plane tickets–thanks to Cebu Pacific promos!–and even a much cheaper Airbnb room, the best one we've stayed at yet! Everything went smoothly!

We stayed at [Toshi's place](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/9318272), and we couldn't ask for a better accomodation for our weekend stay in Manila. Definitely recommended!

# Off to Wanderland Planet!

The event started at already around 2PM. It was hot as shit, and we didn't bring an umbrella. Bad idea.

Wow, we couldn't really believe we're actually seeing the Wanderland set right before our eyes! It just felt so surreal. Can't wait to see our favorite bands play already!

Quick, take photos while there's still few people!

Crowd's getting a little thick now! Time to set up camp, err, mats!

And now, time for some good music! Here are some of the performances we really loved...

# Cheats

The local acts went first: Wanderband winner Oh, Flamingo, Jensen and the Flips, and our favorite among the OPM performances, Cheats (!), who definitely called the animals out of us! _P.S. Saab & Jim relationship goals 5eva <3_

# Panama

Panama! Everyone had to get off their mats and on their feet to sing and dance to the duo's hit songs How We Feel, Jungle and _Aaaalways, I remember you!_

# San Cisco

_![](/images/wanderland/sancisco2.JPG)_

And of course the adorably quirky band from Australia, San Cisco! We couldn't help but sing along to their songs Run, Awkward, Too Much Time Together, and their closing song, Fred Astaire! We were impressed by their drummer, Scarlett, in particular. Jordi, the frontman, was awesome as well, stating that this is the first time he's played in shorts and sandals!

After San Cisco's set, we wandered (no pun intended) around a bit on the games and food section. There were lots of booths to purchase food and drinks from using _Wandertap_, the electronic load system thingy used inside the event grounds. Although this made transactions cashless (not to mention overpriced), it also caused a LOT of problems which resulted in astronomical lengths of queues.

At night, we had to line up for 2 hours just to get food AND another 1 hour to get drinks. Luckily, we chose to line up on the booths where we can still see the stage—we just couldn't miss The Naked & Famous' set!

# The Naked & Famous

And they were so much better live! They played hit songs such as All of This, I Kill Giants (our favorite from the set!), Rolling Waves, and Young Blood, and we enjoyed every moment of it–we thought this was the closest thing to seeing CHVRCHES live.

# Bon Iver

_![](/images/wanderland/boniver3.JPG)_

Bon Iver's set was possibly the highlight of the night. We definitely didn't expect how they sounded live as opposed to their album version—it was harsher, less country-folky and more unforgiving, leaving you with no room to breathe.

The band was accompanied by The Staves (a female vocal trio) and a double drum setup. Their opening song, Perth, with the double-bass hits pounding our chests and an accompanying lights show, caught us off-guard. We regret not being able to record it on video, though on the brightside we got to savor every moment of it.

_![](/images/wanderland/woods.JPG)_

Some of our favorites were Holocene, Lump Sum, and Woods—Justin Vernon's solo performance using a voice processor and a loop machine, not to mention the lighting effects which added to the intensity. This is where we concluded that this guy is indeed a musical genius—that folks, is how you use auto-tune!

_![](/images/wanderland/skinnylove.JPG)_

And of course, when he sat alone on the front and the spotlights turned to him, everyone knew it was time for the crowd favorite—Skinny Love! We all sang our lungs out along to Justin, whose powerful, emotional singing only left everyone's hearts wrecked, just in time for Wanderland's main headliner!

# Death Cab for Cutie

Ah yes, the indie rock legends. Death Cab has always been one of our favorite indie bands since about 6 years ago. In fact, this band may have been one of the few artists that shaped our taste into indie rock music. We couldn't believe we're actually finally seeing them perform live!

They opened their 2 hour set with one of their Kitsungi songs, No Room In Frame. As soon as Ben Gibbard sang _"I don't know where to begin,"_ everyone just went nuts, including us of course. It was so surreal. Ben Gibbard, Death Cab for Cutie, our indie rock heroes, just a few meters away from us!

Highlights from their set range from oldie-but-goodies The New Year, Soul Meets Body, and I Will Follow You Into the Dark (to which everyone sang along), to new ones like You are a Tourist, Black Sun and Little Wanderer. Ben even started taking some of the audience's phones and took selfies. Lucky bastards!

And finally, the time has come for the best part of the night, which also happens to be our most anticipated moment—Transatlanticism. Weeks before Wanderland, even months and years before we even knew they were coming to play in Manila, it has always been our dream to see and experience our favorite band perform live what we consider their masterpiece.

_"I need you so much closer..."_ Fonx and I didn't notice we were actually squeezing each other's hands and arms this whole time.

_"I need you so much closeeer..."_ The build up was intense as the strumming and the drums got louder and louder. Here we go.

_"SO COME OOON, COME OOON..."_

Confetti gushed out from the stage, everyone was clapping and singing along, I was probably in tears.

Ben sang one last _"So come oooon..."_ as the song came to and end, before saying "Thank you Manila, see you again soon!"

It was magical. Thank you, Wanderland, for this unforgettable experience.
