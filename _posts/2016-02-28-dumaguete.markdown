When we learned about the February 24-25, 2016 (Wed-Thurs) holidays, we knew this was the perfect chance for another getaway. We had been eyeing out for Apo Island in Dumaguete City at the time, and decided it was going to be our next destination for the long weekend. Woohoo!

## Day 1: En Route

We left Cebu at around 6am in the morning via the Ceres Liner Bus at the South Bound Bus Terminal. They had a package which includes the 4-hour bus trip as well as the ferry trip from Cebu port (somewhere in Santander) to Dumaguete City proper, which was really convenient.

We arrived in Dumaguete around lunch-time. The distance from our bus drop-off point and our hotel was not too far, so we decided to walk it out instead of taking a motorela—the main mode of tranposrtation in the city—just to have a feel around the new place, also passing by Siliman University along the way.

Our choice of accomodation was [Harold's Mansion](#), since they had a package for unlimited snorkeling at Apo Island for only P1,000 per person. The rooms were cozy and clean, affordable, and includes free breakfast and free coffee throughout the day. The staff were friendly as well, although we had problems with them while booking for our reservation beforehand. We had lunch at their rooftop restaurant, then immediately left off for our first stop!

## Twin Lakes: Balinsasayao and Danao

__How to get there:__ The cheaper option is to take the bus from the terminal which will pass by the Twin Lakes drop-off point and from there, take a habal-habal ride up through the hills and into Twin Lakes. We opted for the more expensive route—we took a habal-habal ride from the city directly to Twin Lakes for convenience and to save time.

The habal-habal drivers offered a round-trip from the city proper to Twin Lakes for P400 each which was way too overpriced! We haggled and finally settled at P300 each, although we still think that's a bit overpriced. So try to haggle down as much as possible, especially if they know you are not from around the city. (Also, regular motorela fare is P10-15).

We arrived at the area after around 45 minutes, and the view was breathtaking. Well, let's just have the photos do the talking.

## Day 2: Apo Island

The Apo Island package includes transportation and lunch. Departure time was supposedly 6:45 AM, but we left Harold's at around 7:30 AM already. Travel time was 30 minutes to the boat drop-off point, and another 30-45 minutes going to Apo Island.

Some important things to take note if you're planning on taking the Harold's Mansion package:

- Our accomodation does include free breakfast but their breakfast opens at 7 AM, which is absurd because departure time for Apo Island is at 6:45 AM. So we weren't able to avail of the free breakfast at all. We had to explore outside the hotel and luckily found a pandesal shop, so we had those and coffee for breakfast instead.
- The Apo Island package __does not__ land on the island itself, which is what we expected. The boats used are merely just for snorkeling or diving a few meters away from the Apo Island. If you want to really get off on the island—which is what we recommend—try getting a different package.
- Although Apo Island is known for sea turtle sightings, they are actually very rare—there is no guarantee that you will meet one up close and personal. Our boat crew said most of them are near the island shores taking care of their eggs (which is another reason why you have to really get on the island if possible). So make sure to make the most out of the unlimited snorkeling until you see one! Oh, and don't forget to always bring your GoPros/underwater cameras all the time—you'll never know when you encounter one!
- The Apo Island package also includes a free lunch, but it's just a bowl of bland pancit and one hard-boiled egg. No drinks, even. It barely filled our empty stomachs, what with the very little breakfast we had. So it's best to prepare food beforehand to bring for the trip. Luckily our boatmates brought lots of bread and fruits to share with everyone. Awesome people!

# Other Must-Do's in Duma

- Buy Silvanas and Sans Rival for _pasalubong_ at Sans Rival Cakes and Pastries, maybe have coffee in there too while you're at it (there's one at Robinson's)
- Visit the famous Siliman University
- Stroll along Boardwalk, maybe snap a photo with the 'I love Dumaguete' sign

So that's it! Overall, it was a great quick 2-day vacation, and we highly recommend Dumaguete as your next destination!
