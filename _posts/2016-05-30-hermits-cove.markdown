intro: When Nix came to Cebu for our <a href="/six-years">Anniversary</a>, there was one night when we realized we didn't have any plans for the next day. So we thought hey why don't we go somewhere. That's when we remembered about a hidden beach called the Hermit's Cove somewhere in Aloguinsan, south Cebu. Suddenly, our usual late-night coffee date turned into a research & planning session for our spontaneous beach & road trip for the next day.

When Nix came to Cebu for our [Anniversary](/six-years), there was one night when we realized we didn't have any plans for the next day. So we thought hey why don't we go somewhere. That's when we remembered about a hidden beach called the __Hermit's Cove__ somewhere in Aloguinsan, south Cebu. Suddenly, our usual late-night coffee date turned into a research & planning session for our spontaneous beach & road trip for the next day.

Several blog posts and online reviews later, we learned that the tourism guys in Aloguinsan are crowd-controlling the place and [centralizing all tours](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=10153614199907123&id=321967567122), so you need to have a reservation beforehand if you want to visit. That's all fine, except it was already almost 12 midnight that time we decided to go!

We had no choice but to wait for the next day and call first thing in the morning. Luckily it was a weekday and there weren't very many people planning to go there so they just accepted walk-in visitors. Whew! We were already thinking of a plan B. Well, off to our spontaneous-ish adFNture!

# Getting There

Before you can enter Hermit's Cove, you need to drop by the __Farmhouse__, or the __Aloguinsan Tourism office__ to pay the entrance fee of __P100/head__. They have other tour packages as well such as the Bojo River Cruise, which we didn't take but suggest that you do if you have the time. They also asked us if we took a habal-habal because if you do, they're also centralizing the fares for those. Pretty convenient since it prevents abusive habal-habal drivers that overprice you like the ones on our [Dumaguete trip](/dumaguete).

Before we went off to the place, one tourism guy left us with only one rule: "Leave nothing but memories!" _(charot)_

The path from the Farmhouse to the Cove is not that far away, although you'd pass by rocky roads and steep mountain cliffs.

A few meters before the destination, you'd pass by cliffs overlooking the eastern Cebu ocean. We couldn't resist but get off the car for a bit and snap a few photos!

This is the first sight you get of the beach once you start going down the long flight of stairs. These photos don't do the view justice though—it's breathtaking, we had to pause for a few seconds, even minutes, to let the moment sink in. "Stop and smell the flowers," as we like to call it.

And we had to keep stopping a few more times every few steps to enjoy the scene. Oh and to take photos too, of course.

A few more steps down and this is what you get. It's this famous staircase leading down to the shore that makes Hermit's Cove stand out from the rest—you don't usually get to see aerial views like these on regular beaches!

It was one of the best unplanned trips we did—and definitely the perfect way to do an extended anniversary celebration!
