The pristine white sand beaches, rich folklore and history, virtually unlimited scallops, or casually listening to the locals conversing in their calming Ilonggo accent while gazing at majestic islands towering over crystal clear turquoise-colored seascapes – where do we start?

# Isla de Gigantes

We first learned about Isla de Gigantes from an ad in our hometown's airport. Since then, it has become one of our dream destinations – we obsessively read about it on blogs and stalked IG photos until we decided we're finally going on Fonx's birthday in June. We wanted to go as soon as possible mainly because at the time, Gigantes was rapidly gaining exposure on social media and news outlets like Rappler and TV Patrol. We wanted to experience the place before it turns into the next staple tourist destination in the Philippines – and mind you, it won't be long before it will.

Isla de Gigantes is a group of islands located in Carles, which is a several-hours land + boat trip from Iloilo City. It's currently gaining traction for its beautiful white sand beaches, rock formations and abundant seafood resources – scallops in particular, which we'll talk more about later! And to top it all off, what really stuck with us even after the trip was the humble island life it offered: there's little to no electricity, internet, cell service, and you have to conserve the fresh water that you fetch from the water tanks if you want to freshen up, and you have to sleep in a cute little nipa hut with a cute little [tuko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokay_gecko) watching over you by the door.

# Island Hopping

The main attraction in Gigantes is the island hopping tour. Some of the most popular sites are Cabugao Gamay, Antonia Beach, Bantigue Sandbar, and Tangke Lagoon, and only takes half a day to visit them all.

## Tangke Saltwater Lagoon

_![](/images/isladegigantes/tangke3.jpg)_

First stop was the majestic lagoon that resembles a giant water tank – thus the name, Tangke. Local myth has it that the waters would magically rise every June 24th, the feast day of John the Baptist.

_![](/images/isladegigantes/tangke.jpg)_

It's best to visit the lagoon in its full glory during high tide, which is why it's also everyone's first stop early in the morning. It would've been so much more picturesque if only there were fewer people. This is where Fonx and I concluded that we might be a tad bit too late to visit Gigantes. The place was already very crowded we could barely get back to our boat as the pathways were tight, steep and very rocky.

## Cabugao Gamay

_![](/images/isladegigantes/cabugao.jpg)_

See that popular aerial image overlooking an island's white beach and a hill? Yep, that's the one! In Cabugao, you get to climb up a rock formation via ropes and ladders so you can get that breathtaking view of the small island – then you'll see why it's called _Gamay_, which means "small" in Bisaya. It's not a trip to Gigantes without this signature shot!

## Bantigue Sandbar

_![](/images/isladegigantes/sandbar.jpg)_

Bantigue Sandbar, or sometimes called just Sandbar, is exactly that, a long strip of pristine white sand. You can take a dip and snorkel in its crystal clear waters, or take a stroll, enjoy the view and snap some photos of the neighboring islands a few meters across. Your choice, but why not both!

## Antonia Beach

One of the bigger white sand beaches is Antonia. When we dropped by, other tourist groups were either snorkeling, setting up camps, or feasting on a sumptuous meal, some were even playing parlor games. As usual, the island is surrounded by cliffs, rock formations, and clear blue water.

## Bulubadiang Island

Our final stop was the private island exclusive to Hideaway Resort's guests only. More on this later!

# Spelunking at Bakwitan Cave

There are more than 70 caves in Gigantes, one of the explorable ones is Bakwitan Cave in Gigantes Norte, a few minutes away from our resort.

It's a rather short trek, but one not to be taken lightly. To exit the cave on the other side, you have to go through several obstacles not for the faint of heart – obstacles where you have to actually climb and precisely plan out your next moves. After the trek, we couldn't stop talking about how one wrong move could potentially lead to a fatal accident.

## History & Lore

The cave got its name from the word "bakwit", which means evacuate, or refuge. Our cave guide told us about how in the past locals used the cave as their sanctuary during the Japanese occupation, and at present, as their evacuation center from storms, especially typhoon Yolanda. Well, that sounds heart-warming and all 'til you hear about the myth of the _gigantes_.

Local folklore say that the island was formerly inhabited by giants – during the Spanish era, residents unearthed coffins inside Bakwitan Cave containing gigantic sets of human bones. Hence the name, Isla de Gigantes. __Island of the Giants.__ Creepy!



# Scallops, scallops, even more scallops

_![](/images/isladegigantes/scallops2.jpg)_

Gigantes is said to be the scallop capital of the Philippines, and rightfully so. Upon arrival to Gigantes island, you don't step on sand – you step on scallop shells! Yep, scallop shells are basically sand in Carles. They're ridiculously abundant that they sell them at 1 peso each. EACH! Locals tell us they're already having a hard time disposing of the shells, which is why mountains of them are a common sight in the island.

_![](/images/isladegigantes/scallops.jpg)_

In Gigantes Hideaway Resort, our meals are always ALWAYS served with a scallop dish or two – baked scallops, sizzling scallops, grilled scallops, scallops on barbecue sticks, the list goes on.

Meanwhile, back in the city, I'll just have my 8-pcs baked scallops for 300 pesos.



# Bulubadiang Island

A 3-minute bangka ride across Gigantes Norte lies the humble little Bulubadiang Island, a private extension island owned by Gigantes Hideaway Resort, which means the whole place is exclusive to us guests! Woohoo!

_![](/images/isladegigantes/bulubadiang7.jpg)_

We stayed in Bulubadiang for the whole second day until the next morning. There's not much to do in the island except to "stop and smell the flowers," which, is pretty much everything to me and Fonx – just chillin' in the laid back al fresco atmosphere, listening to reggae and tropical house, bird-watching, sunset-gazing, or beach strolling, exploring the rest of the island.

_![](/images/isladegigantes/bulubadiang2.jpg)_

One unique feature the island offers is that during sunset, the water is so low that it's actually possible to get back to the main island by foot!

# _Salamat gid_, Iloilo!

_![](/images/isladegigantes/cabugao6.jpg)_

Wow, it's no doubt our epic 4-day _adfnture_ is something to write home about. Fonx and I have traveled to almost a dozen places, and while we don't usually say this, Gigantes is one we definitely would want to come back to in the future.

Thank you Iloilo, for this wonderful gem of a paradise. This is why we travel. Our love for the country only grew more – just like the islands – _gigantic_.
